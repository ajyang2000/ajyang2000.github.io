					<h1>ABOUT</h1>
					I am a Bachelor's of Science graduate with Distinctions at the University of Toronto. My experiences vary from Artificial Intelligence, Web Design, and Game Design, aside from the basics in Computer Science, such as Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming. Out of all my experiences, my interest has always been in Artificial Intelligence and Game Design. Games are the fuel that drives my positivity and motivation in programming, and it is one of the factors that drive my interest in Computer Science. My career goal is to create entertaining applications that contributes to the society and daily lives.
