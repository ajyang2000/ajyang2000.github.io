				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. My experiences vary from Artificial Intelligence, Web Design, Game Design and Computer Systems. Out of all my experiences, my interest has always been in Artificial Intelligence and Game Design. Games are the fuel that drives my positivity and motivation in programming, and it is one of the factors that drive my interest in Computer Science. My career goal is to create entertaining applications that contributes to the society and daily lives.

				<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
				The following are some of the projects and experiences throughout my academic career:

				<!-- POLARIS Project -->
				<div class="project">
					<h2>POLARIS INTELLIGENCE WEBSITE (September 2020 to April 2021)</h2>
					<span class="course"> Course: APS490 - Multidisciplinary Capstone Design </span>
					<p>
						Polaris Intelligence is an online business intelligence application that provides users with consumer data and analytical insights via their online applicaiton. The current application is managed using PHP and JavaScript. However, PHP is currently deprecated, which causes the interface to appear simple and plain whereas JavaScript has limited capabilities, such as the ability to not easily implement drag and drop functionality. As a result, our client, <b>Polaris Intelligence</b>, is seeking a next-generation front end application. For this capstone project, done in collaboration with three other students in differing diciplines, aimed to improve on the current, outdated interface of Polaris Intelligence's online application using Node.js and React. 
					</p>
					<p>
						After understanding the problem better via meetings with the clients, the team analyzed the existing design of the interface, comparing the application to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's <i>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</i></a>. From the analysis, the team were able to generate three different low fidelity prototypes, where each prototype focused greatly on one of:
						<ol>
							<li>User interactions (For instance, hovering over buttons)</li>
							<li>Ease of navigation to common pages of the application</li>
							<li>Improving client's requirements</li>
						</ol>
						The low fidelity prototypes were then analyzed and used in creating a final proposed candidate design, which includes a wireframe of the prototype as well as a digital visualization of the prototype. The proposed candidate design was then used as a stepping stone for the high fidelity prototype.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>
						For the project, I was the primary member responsible for communications in the team. As such, I was tasked with scheduling the necessary meetings with the client and our supervisor, as well as personally contacting the team members in case of a problem. Additionally, any deliverables sent to the supervisor and inquiries for the state of the project were handled by me. Apart from communications, I have contributed to designing the project requirements and design proposal documents and creating an alternative design for the current application as of this date.
					</p> 
					This team project showcased the skills learnt during my academic career. The following skills were utilized in creating an application for the client in a progressive format.
					<ul>
						<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript - used in designing the final prototype</li>
						<li>Collaboration - contributed the knowledge gained from my discipline towards the final project, as well as incorporating the knowledge with the other disciplines</li>
						<li>Time Management - ensured that the internal deadlines were met and considered for unexpected scenarios </li>
					</ul>
					Apart from the existing skills, the project also developed the following, which was useful in solving this problem:
					<ul>
						<li>Node.js and React</li>
						<li>External Communications, specifically with clients</li>
						<li>Project Management Skills</li>
					</ul>

				<!-- Teafenders Project -->
				<div class="project">
					<h2>TEAFENDERS (September 2020 to December 2020)</h2>
					<span class="course"> Course: CSC404 - Introduction to Video Game Design </span><br/>
					<span class="link"> Link to itch.io page: <a href="https://saucergames.itch.io/teafenders">Teafenders by Saucer Games</a> </span>
					<p>
						The project required for this course involves creating a 3D game with various students in the University of Toronto Computer Science, University of Toronto Music, Centennial College Game Art and Centennial College Animation. For this project, the team, comprised of a total of 12 students and myself, created a casual cooperative game, called <b>Teafenders</b>. Teafenders is a short defense game where 1-4 players protect teacups from living teabags for a given time. Teamwork is a core element and is best suited for a group of players. Throughout the period of 10 weeks, the beta version of the game was developed, incorporating any feedback given by the students, professors or any well established studios such as Ubisoft Toronto, Snowman and Zynga.
					</p>

					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>
						This team project showcased mainly my programming knowledge. During the pre-alpha state of the project, I initially contributed to the mechanics (movement, jump and attacking) and implementing the animations (walk) of the players’ character, utilizing my programming skills in Unity and C#. From the alpha version onwards, my main contribution was on the UI aspects of the game, both in the menus and in-game. These tasks include:
						<ul>
							<li>Completing the button functions for each menu</li>
							<li>Loading the appropriate images when the character and level are selected. Also, I needed to ensure that the correct data is sent to the UI during gameplay.</li>
							<li>Implementing the UI on each character’s models</li>
							<li>Scaling the UI to adjust to screen size </li>
							<li>Creating a save and load system for the scores</li>
						</ul>

				<!-- Cash Calculator Project -->
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Cash Calculator (January 2020)</h2>
					<span class="course"> Course: CSC301 - Introduction to Software Engineering </span><br/>
					<p>
						The project for this course required my team, consisting of University of Toronto students, to work on designing an application requested by a client. In this case, our client, <b>My Oral Village</b>, requested a prototype application, called "Cash Calculator", whose main target users are illiterate and innumerate people. The purpose of the application is to translate arithmetic notation into cash sums.
					</p>

					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>
						As part of the team, I utilized my programming knowledge and documentation capabilities to assist in creating the prototype. Also, I further developed my knowledge in the project management with the Agile methodology, software development process and team collaboration.
