			<div class="about">
				<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. My experiences vary from Artificial Intelligence, Web Design, Game Design and Computer Systems. Out of all my experiences, my interest has always been in Artificial Intelligence and Game Design. Games are the fuel that drives my positivity and motivation in programming, and it is one of the factors that drive my interest in Computer Science. My career goal is to create entertaining applications that contributes to the society and daily lives.

				<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
				The following are some of the projects and experiences throughout my academic career:

				<!-- POLARIS Project -->
				<div class="project">
					<h2>POLARIS INTELLIGENCE WEBSITE (September 2020 to April 2021)</h2>
					<span class="course"> Course: APS490 - Multidisciplinary Capstone Design </span>
					<p>
						The design of this web application is done as part of my capstone project course on <b>APS490 - Multidisciplinary Capstone Design</b>. The capstone project, done in collaboration with three other students in differing disciplines, was to improve on the current, outdated interface of Polaris Intelligence’s online application using Node.js and React.
					</p>
					<h3>Design Goal</h3>
					Improve the current design of Polaris Intelligence’s online application that is compatible with the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Perform similar tasks as the current design</li>
						<li>Fast and secure</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Skills that I contributed</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>Collaboration</li>
						<li>Time Management</li>
						<li>Communications</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Skills gained from this project</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Node.js and React</li>
						<li>External Communications, specifically with clients.</li>
						<li>Project Management Skills</li>

					</ul>

					<h3>Contributions</h3>
					I am the primary person responsible for communications. As such, my tasks include scheduling meetings with the client and the supervisor, as well as contacting the team members if needed. Apart from communications, I have contributed to designing the project requirements and design proposal documents and creating an alternative design for the current application as of this date.

				<!-- Teafenders Project -->
				<div class="project">
					<h2>TEAFENDERS (September 2020 to December 2020)</h2>
					For the project of the class on Video Game Design, I worked along a team totaling of 12 students from the disciplines of Computer Science, Music, Art and Animation, to create a casual coop game, called Teafenders. Teafenders is a short defense game where 1-4 players protect teacups from living teabags for a given time.
					During the pre-alpha state of the project, I initially contributed to the mechanics (movement, jump and attacking) and implementing the animations (walk) of the players’ character. From the alpha version onwards, my sole responsibility was on the UI aspects of the game, both in the menus and in-game. These tasks include:
					<ul>
						<li>Completing the button functions for each menu</li>
						<li>Loading the appropriate images when the character and level are selected. Also, I needed to ensure that the correct data is sent to the UI during gameplay.</li>
						<li>Implementing the UI on each character’s models</li>
						<li>Scaling the UI to adjust to screen size </li>
						<li>Creating a save and load system for the scores</li>
					</ul>
